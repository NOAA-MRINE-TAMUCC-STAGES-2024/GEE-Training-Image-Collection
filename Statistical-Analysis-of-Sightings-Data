CREAT YOUR LIST OF IMAGES FIRST
You will need your list of GEE Sentinal images, and an excel file listing sightings data to complete this step. Our Excel files were named "spreadsheet_of_google_images_meta_data.xlsx" and "sightings.xlsx" respectively.
This code will create an excel file called "sightings_statistics.xlsx"
Run some statistics on the "sightings" excel file to find out which 3 months had the most sightings and list all of the sightings in those 3 months in a new excel sheet named "sightings_statistics". then in sheet 2 of the excel file, list how many sightings are in each of those months for all of the years of data. And a third sheet that lists the top 3 years for those top 3 months.
